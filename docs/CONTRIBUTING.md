## Adding new features

Feel free to add new features as you see fit! Please open an issue first, to make sure no one else is working on it, then go for it! Fork the repo, make a pull request back in, and I'll get you added to the contributors list!

Donâ€™t get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the
maintainers is around: a week, tops.
